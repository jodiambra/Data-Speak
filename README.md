## Task

The task is to train a machine learning model that can automatically generate answers to written questions a user inputs. For this purpose, we will train a model with questions and answers using the Python Questions from Stack Overflow dataset. 

The input to our model would be the written questions (in English), and the model produces the top answers along with a measure of certainty of it being the correct answer (i.e. confidence interval in percentage). Once an accurate model was trained, an application for a user interface was built where the user could input the question in a text box, and the Top five answers appear (along with the measure of confidence).
